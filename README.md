# Insteon-Hubitat

Hubitat driver for direct control of insteon devices

**Features**

• Ramp Rate - The Insteon device hardware Ramp Rates are supported, but user definition of Ramp Rates via the driver is not. Therefore, the Duration field in the driver does not serve any purpose and must be left blank. However, by activating and deactivating Insteon Scenes, you can control ramp rate. Insteon scenes can be controlled via any Insteon device that supports scene activation, and any device or rule on Hubitat Elevation.

• Instant device status

• Insteon Scene Control via HTTP Get from Button Controller or Rule Machine

• Automated Child device creation and Insteon Device ID capture

• Organized Parent/Child device structure

Compatible device types

**Minimum requirements**

Insteon 2245-222 Hub (The previous 2242-222 and the newer 2243-222 HomeKit hubs are untested)
Dedicated computer or Raspberry Pi with Node.js installed to run the insteonserver.js and the client.js event listener applications.
Insteon devices

**Installation**

*Insteon Server Node.js application*

The insteon-server has been forked to make changes in some of the files to support Hubitat Elevation, and additional features. Please use files found here, rather than those from Scott Kuester's GitHub repository.

To install the Insteon Server Node.js application, follow these steps:

# Raspberry Pi specific instructions

I don't use monitors with a Raspberry Pi. Never have, and never intended to. So my instructions are all how to set this up via ssh. However, if you want to run headless, you'll need further instruction then I'm providing here because the shell windows have to otherwise remain open or the insteon server and client listener applications will not continue to run.

**Step 1** Install Raspbian Buster. If you use the latest Raspbian OS, they have removed the default pi account, so you won't be able to set this up via ssh without first attaching a. monitor and keyboard to create an account to log into ssh. And then if you're doing that, well then what's the point in using ssh to do this, right?

**Step 2** Most sd card imaging software will automatically eject the miroSD card after writing, so remove the card from the reader and then pop it back in so it’s available to your system again. You will not see the whole volume, but you will be able to access the boot directory.

**Step 3** If you’re using a Raspberry Pi with built-in Ethernet, you don’t need to do anything to add WiFi support and you can skip to **Step 5**. If you’re not (e.g. A Raspberry Pi ZeroW), then you’ll need to add a **wpa_supplicant.conf** file. This is just a text file you create with nothing more than the text below in the file. The easiest way to do this is with Atom text editor. Just create a new file and paste the text below into it, modifying the ssid with your actual WiFi name you want the Raspberry Pi to connect to, and the psk with your WiFi password.

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

network={

ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"

psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"

key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

}

**Step 4** Save the text file as “wpa_supplicant.conf” to the root level of the Boot directory. It will be automatically moved to the required directory when the Raspberry Pi boots.

**Step 5** Add ssh capability by creating an empty file with no extension. Again you can use Atom text editor to save an empty text file named “ssh” to the root level of the boot directory on the microSD card. Another way to do this is to open a terminal app and type

> cd /volumes/boot

then type

> touch ssh

Same result. An empty file named ssh with no extension.

**Step 6** Download the Insteon server file and unzip it.

If you will not be using Insteon keypad, then delete the file “insteonserver.js” and instead use the file that is located in the directory labelled “insteonserver.js without Keypad support”.

If you do need Insteon Keypad support, then delete the folder labelled “Insteonserver.js without Keypad support”. **Do not keep both files!**

**Step 7** Rename the folder “Insteon-server-master” to “Insteon-server” and then zip compress it again.

**Step 8** Copy the file “Insteon-server.zip” to the root level of the microSD card.

**Step 9** Close the terminal and any text editors that you have been using to add files to the microSD card, and then eject it from your computer.

**Step 10** Install the micro SD card in your Raspberry Pi and plug it in.

**Step 11** ssh into the Raspberry Pi

> ssh pi@192.168.x.x

Enter the default password

> raspberry

**NOTE:** It is highly recommended that you change the default password for the **pi** account. To do this type

> passwd

But, don't forget to write down the new password, or you'll have to start over from the beginning.

**Step 12** Change to the lib directory

> cd usr/local/lib

**Step 13** Download node.js

> curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -

**Step 14** Install node.js

> sudo apt install nodejs

**Step 15** Check that node is installed and you have the version expected.

> node -v

**Step 16** Create the directory node_modules

> sudo mkdir node_modules

**Step 17** Copy the Insteon-server file you saved in the boot directory to the node_modules directory

> sudo cp /boot/insteon-server.zip /usr/local/lib/node_modules

**Step 18** Change to the node_modules directory

> cd node_modules

**TIP:** If you get lost along the way, you can check what directory level you’re currently in with

> pwd

To see what’s in the current directory, use

> ls

**Step 19** Unzip the Insteon-server archive

> sudo unzip Insteon-server.zip

**Step 20** Take a moment to do some clean-up and remove the .zip file you no longer need

> sudo rm -R Insteon-server.zip

**Step 21** Change to the Insteon-server directory

> cd Insteon-server

**Step 22** Install the Insteon server app

> sudo npm -g install

**Step 23** Install the dependencies

> sudo npm install -g home-controller

> sudo npm install -g express

> sudo npm install -g ws

**Step 24** Edit the config-example.json file. When editing the config.json file, remove any devices you do not own. The username and password from your insteon hub **must** replace [Insteon Hub Username] and [Insteon Hub Password] in the config.json file. **Atom Text editor** is highly recommended for editing on MacOS, and **Nano** is a very easy to use editor included in the Raspbian OS.

> sudo nano config-example.json

**NOTE**: The Insteon hub port in the config.js file must be 25105, but the node.js **server port**, which is labelled "server_port" in the config.js file, can be any open port you need it to be. What's important is that the node.js "server_port" specified in the config.js file **must** match the server port specified in the insteonserver.js file.

Name the devices the way you would like them to appear in your Hubitat Elevation hub.
Replace all the [Insteon Device ID] in the config.json file with the actual device ID from your Insteon mobile app (Letters and Numbers only. **Do not add periods or colons**) It is important to properly enter your Insteon Device ID numbers, as this is how the child devices will be created on the Hubitat Elevation hub. If you do not enter the Insteon Device ID for each of your devices in the config.json file, its corresponding child device will not be created on your HE hub.

For Keypads, the device type should be "**scene**".

**NOTE**: **There is no need to change the device type from "lightbulb"**. I've been controlling multiple Instoen dimmers for years with the config.json file using "lightbulb" instead of "dimmer" regardless of whether or not it is actually a lightbulb, dimmer or switch. However, you must set "dimmable": **no** in the config.json file if the device type is a switch, a non-dimmable outlet, ON/OFF Micro Module, or an IOLinc.

**Step 25** Save the config.json file

Press **ctrl-o**

**Step 26** Change the name from config-example.json to config.json

Press enter to confirm the name change. Nano will prompt you, asking if you want to save the file under a different name. You do, so just press

> y

**Step 27** Exit nano

> Press **ctrl-x**

**Step 28** Start the server and client listener

Open a shell window (Raspbian) or terminal window (Mac OS), and type

> /usr/local/lib/node_modules/insteon-server/
 
Start the Insteon Server node.js application by typing
node insteonserver.js

You should see the following in your shell or terminal window:

**Connecting to Insteon Model 2245 Hub... Initiating websocket... Connected to Insteon Model 2245 Hub...**

**Step 29** Open a second shell window (Raspbian) or terminal window (Mac OS), and again type

> cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/insteon-server/

Start the Insteon client listener by typing

> node client.js

You should see the following in the client.js shell or terminal window:

**Connected to Insteon Server**

WARNING: If you don't start the client.js application, you won't be able to generate the child devices, get device status updates, or use Insteon motion, contact and leak sensors.


# Insteon WS Parent and Child device drivers

Through the use of web sockets, this new driver will update status immediately, and will capture the status of Insteon input devices such as contact, motion, and leak sensors. Any periodic refresh rules used with the previous driver should be removed.

## Adding the Insteon driver code to Hubitat Elevation**

Choose **Select All** on the RAW code window, then copy and paste the code into a new driver code window in Hubitat Elevation and press SAVE
Repeat until you have added the parent and each of the child device drivers.

**Step 1** Copy the parent driver by pressing the RAW button at the top right and paste it into a new driver window on Hubitat Elevation. Refer to the Hubitat docs for to to install devices drivers if you have never done this before. Be sure that after you select the link for the parent driver code, you then press the RAW button at the top right of the driver code window. This will ensure you have all the correct code, without any missing elements or accidentally included special characters.

**Step 2** Copy each of the [child device driver code files](https://github.com/logname/Insteon-Hubitat), creating a new driver file for each on your Hubitat Elevation hub. Be sure that after you select the link for the child driver, you then press the RAW button at the top right of the driver code window. This will ensure you have all the correct code, without any missing elements or accidentally included special characters.

## Installing the Insteon WS Parent driver on your Hubitat Elevation hub**

**Step 1** Refer to the Hubitat Elevation device driver documentation if you have never installed a device driver before.

**Step 2** Name your Parent device driver, and set the type to **Insteon WS Parent**

**Step 3** Press the *Save Device* button

**Step 4** Configure the driver as follows:

![Screen Shot 2019-08-12 at 11 04 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9291086/164882860-fd3898c3-4a69-4247-9e92-ad7944e45a9a.png)

**Step 5** Turn off "Enable debug logging". When you create a new device, debug logging is enabled by default. Some users have said that when debug logging was enabled in the parent device, the child devices were not created after completing the next steps.

**Step 6** Press the *Save Preferences* button, then scroll down and select the *Save Device* button again.

**Step 7** Press the *Initialize* button. You should see **connected** under the *Current States* field. If you do not see **connected**. ensure that both the insteonserver.js application and client.js applications have been started on your node.js server.

Your child device ID numbers (Insteon Device ID numbers) should all show up in the State Variables field.
In your Hubitat Elevation devices list, you should see the *Insteon WS Parent* app with the name you gave it, and all of your Insteon devices with the names you assigned to each device in the config.json file.
You may now include your Insteon devices in Hubitat Elevation automations. I have personally been running this new driver with all my Insteon devices since late June of 2019, and it continues to perform perfectly. Very fast with no issues or conflicts of any kind.

# Controlling Insteon Scenes

This can be done by sending HTTP request directly to the Insteon hub. With this, you can control the ramp rate of Insteon devices per button, rule action, switch, mode change, etc.

**Example:**

> ON group 11 (scene 1)
http://[username]:[password]@[insteon hub IP]:25105/0?1111=I=0

> OFF group 11 (scene 1)
http://[username]:[password]@[insteon hub IP]:25105/0?1311=I=0

Once you have the credentials and Insteon hub IP info, it's just copy past from then on. It's only the last four digits before =I=0 that change depending on the state or the scene group ID number. So in the above example, 1111 is ON for Group ID 11 and 1311 is OFF for Group ID 11

# How to add and remove devices from your Insteon 2245-222 hub

Now that the ability to use the Insteon app is gone, you will need to manually add devices to the hub. There are ways to do this with open source software, but you can also do this by using the **Link** button on the 2245 hub, or by using the following HTTP commands. Even if you accidentally reset your Insteon hub, you should be able to re-link devices by using the buttons on the hub and the link method on the device, or recreate groups using the HTTP method below. If you need to configure embedded devices, or if just want a convenient configuraiton tool for you devices, I suggest Insteon Control Panel for Home Assistant by Tom Harris (which will soon be included with the Home Assistant Insteon driver) - https://community.home-assistant.io/t/insteon-control-panel/234145/41

**NOTE**: You will need to find your Insteon hub IP address by looking at the DCHP address table, or the MAC address table of your router. Every router will be different. Consult your router manual by downloading it from the manufacturer's website or do some searching online for answers using your router's brand and model number if a manual isn't available. If your hub has never been named, it will probably show up in a DHCP table as "Smarthome". But if your router doesn't display device names in the DHCP table, look for the matching **MAC Address** to the one shown on the bottom of your 2245-222 hub.

**Example of an Insteon MAC Address**

`00:0E:F3:x:x:x` (where the **x** will be two HEX values unique to your particular Insteon hub).

Before you start, it’s important to understand some basics around how to form the URL to enable linking. Since you can join devices by Group (Scene) you will have the ability to add devices to your hub and to a particular Insteon Scene. You don’t have to use Insteon Scenes, but without their use you will either get a popcorn effect from your lights when you try to control several of them at once with a non-Insteon group, or some of the Insteon devices may not respond at all if you're trying to use a non-Insteon group to control multiple at once. Insteon Scenes will send out a single group message, where all Insteon devices in that Insteon Group (Scene) will respond simultaneously, with no popcorn effect, and no missed commands by any Insteon device that is a member of that group.

The following are HTTP commands from the [Insteon Developer Guide](http://cache.insteon.com/developer/2242-222dev-062013-en.pdf). You should probably download this for reference while you still can. The guide is from the 2242-222 hub, but the commands are the same for the 2245-222 hub.

<img width="1085" alt="Insteon URL breakdown" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9291086/164883500-2069864c-a5ab-4a65-a3ef-324f4ce1227b.png">

The remainder of the URL contains the commands for linking/unlinking, together with the group you want to add the device to, or the group you want to removed the device from.

**Enter Linking Mode to group 10**

/0?**09**10=I=0

**Enter Unlinking Mode from Group 10**

/0?**0A**10=I=0

**Cancel Linking or Unlinking Mode**

/0?**08**=I=0

**Examples:**

**Set the hub into Linking mode to add a device to Group (Scene) 10**
Here **09** is the HEX command to put the Insteon hub into **Linking** mode, and **10** is the Insteon Group it will join.

>http://Annie:ytyYUbva@192.168.0.146:25105/0?**0910**=I=0
**Set the hub into Unlinking mode to remove a device from Group (Scene) 10**
Here **0A** is the HEX command to put the Insteon hub into **Unlinking** mode, and **10** is the Insteon Group it will leave.

>http://Annie:ytyYUbva@192.168.0.146:25105/0?**0A10**=I=0
**Cancel Linking or Unlinking Mode (Group number doesn’t have to be included and will be ignored if it is included together with the Cancel Linking/Unlinking command).**
Here **08** is the HEX command to **Cancel** linking or unlinking mode, and even though **10** for the Group is still included in the URL, it is unnecessary for a **Cancel** command. However it can safely be left included if you just want to change the HEX value before the Group number in the URL. It will be ignored in this case.

>http://Annie:ytyYUbva@192.168.0.146:25105/0?**0810**=I=0`
**Turn OFF Group (Scene)** **10**
Here **11** is the HEX command to turn **OFF** the devices in Group 10

> http://Annie:ytyYUbva@192.168.0.146:25105/0?**1110**=I=0
**Turn ON Group (Scene)** **10**
Here **12** is the HEX command to turn **ON** the devices in Group 10

> http://Annie:ytyYUbva@192.168.0.146:25105/0?**1210**=I=0
1. To use the HTTP commands, first send your constructed URL via a web browser by entering it in the address bar. You must include the Hub user name and password in your URL. Nothing will happen if you don't.

2. After entering the URL in your browser address bar, you may need to press enter twice to get a response from the hub. Once the light is flashing on the hub, press and hold the link button on your device until you hear a quick double-beep and its light stops flashing. It should instantly join. Repeat the process for each device you want to add to a particular Group on your Insteon hub.

3. Use the **ON** and **OFF** URL examples above to test your devices are added to the group you intended and are all responding as expected.

How to control groups from Hubitat

You can control Insteon groups from a Hubitat Elevation hub without installing any drivers or software by sending an HTTP command using GET with Hubitat Rule Machine or Button Controller.
